* Requirements

- ~shnsplit~
- ~cuetag.sh~

Details can be found on [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CUE_Splitting][archwiki]].

* How to use

- Build the ~jar~ file from source
- Create a new directory and ~cd~ into it
- Move the ~cue~ file and audio file into the directory
- Run ~java -jar cue_autosplit.jar .~

* Caveats

- The char encoding detection might not be correct. If it does not work well,
  you need to create a file ~converted__.cue~ in the same directory with UTF-8
  encoding in the same directory and then run the program.
